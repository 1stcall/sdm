sdm was inspired by posts by @HawaiianPi and @sakaki in the Raspberry Pi Forum: [STICKY: Making your own custom burn-n-boot Raspbian image](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=63&t=231762).

The sdm documentation reorg inspired by feedback from github user @mcguirepr89.

Thanks to @dshaw619 and @tiefenauer for their wonderful suggestions and patience.

And thanks to the many other users who have provided constructive feedback and patiently worked with me to resolve problems.

Thanks!
