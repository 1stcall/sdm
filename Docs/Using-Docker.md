# Using Docker

sdm does not currently work with Docker.

If you are interested in seeing this work, AND are fairly Docker-enlightened, please consider providing me with a "sdm on Docker" cookbook that an unenlightened Docker user like me can follow.

Once such a guide is provided and I am able to verify that it works, I'll include it in the sdm Documentation.
