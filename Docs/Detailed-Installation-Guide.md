# Detailed Installation Guide

Installation is simple. sdm must be installed in and uses the path `/usr/local/sdm` both on your running system and within images that it manages. **The simplest way to install sdm is to use EZsdmInstaller**, which performs the commands listed in *the really long way*:

    curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitbls/sdm/master/EZsdmInstaller | bash

**Or, download the Installer script to examine it before running:**

    curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitbls/sdm/master/EZsdmInstaller -o ./EZsdmInstaller
    chmod 755 ./EZsdmInstaller
    # Inspect the EZsdmInstaller script if desired
    sudo ./EZsdmInstaller
